Inspiration-

Fitness is one of the most paramount things in life and one of the way to keep track of fitness is to count the number of steps you've walked in a day. StepDetection app essentially gives you a way of tracking the steps at the comfort of your palm using the smartphone accelerometer.

Challenges faced-

One of the most aspect of designing the app was to maintain acuracy of the steps counted. Initially while working on the app I decided to use the usual process of calculating the distance by double integrating the acceleration and hence counting the steps. But on double integration the errors during the calculations were far too large and the steps were not reflecting properly. The current design uses threshold and peak to calculate steps accurately.

Future Scope-

The larger picture in implementing this project was to design an indoor navigation system for places such as caves where the people would easily get lost. The idea was to calculate the steps and the direction and backtrace the path back to the original point so that the person lost inside can easily navigate back. The backtracking navigation was designed to be implemented in AR.
